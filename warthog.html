                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family (Suidae) found in grassland, savanna, and woodland 
                        in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                    <p>In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia,
                         and eastern Ethiopia.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 metres (2 feet 11 inches to 4 feet 11 inches), and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm (2 ft 1 in to 2 ft 9+1‚ÅÑ2 in). Females, at 45 to 75 kilograms (99 to 165 pounds), are typically slightly smaller and lighter in weight than males,
                         at 60 to 150 kg (130 to 330 lb).</p> 
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>  
                    <P>Can be found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
